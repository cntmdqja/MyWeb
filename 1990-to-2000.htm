<h2> National Context</h2>
<p>With the rising awareness of the link of higher education and globalization, especially with high profile publications such as the Rand report on global preparedness (Bikson &amp; Law, 1994), some study abroad professionals begin to increasingly wonder why more students in underrepresented disciplines are not studying abroad. The confluence of these streams leads to new paradigms and models for growth in study abroad (Woodruff, 2009).</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the field begins to focus on Intercultural Competence.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the Secussa website was implemented by committee members Charles Gliozzo, Paul Primak, Marvin Slind and Bill Hoffa. SECCUS-L was the first e-mail listserv for international communication amongst international educators. The website presently has approximately 6,000 subscribers (Gliozzo, 2012).</p>
<p>The Forum on Education Abroad begins in 2001. </p>

<h2> At MSU</h2>
<p>In 1995, the MSU Internal Review Committee issued <i>A Changing University for a Changing World: Michigan State's Global Future</i>, which includes a series of recommendations about study abroad at MSU.  As a result, President McPherson appoints a task force to assess the opportunities and constraints for greatly expanding study abroad (Michigan State University, 1995).</p>
<p>McPherson's directive in the early years to achieve a 40 percent participation rate signals that study abroad is an institutional priority and highlights internationalization as integral to MSU's institutional culture.</p>
<p>The study abroad field is still getting comfortable with the value of faculty-led, short-term programs while MSU is already at a 4:1 ratio of 4 students on short-term for 1 on long-term, which is ahead of the field.</p>
<p>In 2003, MSU scholars Hult and Lashbrooke publish the book &quot;Study Abroad perspectives and experiences from business schools&quot; highlighting study abroad as a viable option for business students. </p>
<p>In 2009, MSU is ranked #4 among large colleges and universities for Peace Corps volunteers.</p>

<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
<p>Michael Vande Berg becomes Director in 1995. </p>
<p>Incentive-based budgeting model is developed to promote short-term, faculty-led program.  From its inception, the model involves undergraduate departments and instructors in planning and developing programs overseas (Smuckler, 2003). It is believed that MSU faculty will assure quality of instruction by traveling abroad with students and teaching and this allowed for program expansion (Smuckler).</p>
<p>Shared governance implemented via Deans' Designees committee beginning in 1996.</p>
<p>60 new programs come online, including semester direct-enrollment opportunities. Processes for managing credit transfer for co-sponsored programs are established.</p>

<p>OSA collaborates with the College of Arts &amp; Letters in 2001 to develop a for-credit study abroad pre-departure course called &quot;Cultural Differences in Study Abroad&quot;. The course continues to offer students at MSU with the tools for understanding and interacting with individuals from different cultural backgrounds, how to foster awareness and sensitivity to cultural differences, and the learning about the role of language study in understanding cultural differences. </p>
